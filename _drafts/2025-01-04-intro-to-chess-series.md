# What can chess teach us about making decisions?

<!--more-->

The simple game of Chess is profoundly more complex than any of us can imagine. In 1950, the founder of information theory Claude Shannon estimated there are over $$10^{120}$$ different possible games of chess. For context, this number is **40 orders of magnitude bigger** than the number of atoms in the universe, which already estimated to be around $$10^{80}$$!

Much to my perfectionist disappointment, there is simply no way for us to play a game of chess perfectly. In principle, either white or black should always be able to win at a game of chess if they play exactly the right moves. The problem is that we have no clue which ones those are. There are simply far too many options for our computers let alone us to check every single one and figure out which ones lead to a victory.

It is remarkable then that humans are able to select moves amongst all these possibilities through strategies we developed. Only through concepts such as position or piece value are we able to make reasonable moves in finite time with finite brains. Life is very much the same way. We have countless options before us but 70 or so years to explore them. Furthermore, it takes energy to make decisions. To lessen the burden that comes with this freedom, we can turn to heruristics or principles to help guide our decision making.

In this series, I want to explore further through chess as to how we can "chunk" reality into digestible pieces we can use to make good decisions. This will be a three part series as follows:

1. The history of chess and its strategy

2. The story of how computers beat chess

3. The future of chess using interpretable AI
