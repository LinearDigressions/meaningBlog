## What is interpretation? 
<!--more-->

Interpretation is our gateway to reality. Everything we percieve and understand about the world arises from our capacity to interpret and make meaning from it. Our eyes turn light into cars, books and other people. Our ears turn wave perturbations into music, laughter, and conversation. Each of these involves a transformation from that which is raw and unprocessed into that which is useful and meaningful to us.

This blog hopes to explore all the magic that lurks behind interpretation we easily take for granted by exploring it from different angles and relying upon science and philosophy to understand it better. To begin, I want to provide a brief working definiton of interpretation. This is by no means complete but will be developed over time. Consider this version 1.0. 

**Interpretation is the process by which a subject transforms data into meaning.**

This definition includes four key ideas: subject, transforms, data and meaning. We consider each of these in turn. Let us first consider the word **subject**.

### Subject

I wasn't sure whether to include the word subject at first but eventually I realized that interpretation is meaningless without a subect. There are many facets on what it means to be a subject. However, I have decided to focus strictly on the notion of viewpoint or perspecitve into the world. My notion of subject also includes things that are not conscious but still can be said to have a certain perspective into the world such as a thermostat observing the temperature of a room.

**A subject is anything with a point of view.**

### Transforms

A transformation (or interpretive schema / framework) is a function applied by a subject to data. An important clarification is that the transformation does not have to be performed consciously. It is merely a change enacted by whatever we may call the subject. My idea of transformation is very similar to that of a mathematical relation/function.

**A transformation is any change applied to data that is observed by the subject.**

### Data

Data can take many forms ranging from pure numbers to visual data to words and language. This definition is extremely broad but the key idea is that data is anything that presents itself to a subject. Data is generally persumed to be quantitative in its raw form but then takes on qualitative properties as experienced by the subject.


**Data is anything that a subject observes or experiences.**

### Meaning

Meaning is the output of the transformation. This is the qualitative result produced by the subject. Meaning can take on many forms such as qualia (subjective experience like color), emotions, or understanding. Very often, meaning is then utilized by the subject to perform a certain action. My use of the word meaning is similar to how others might use information. I don't like using the word interpretation mainly because there are already very specific definitions of information mathematically and my notion of meaning is much broader than those. I think the definition in Information Theory is useful and will come up in this blog.

**Meaning is the result of the transformation applied by the subject.**

## Open Questions

These overly simplified definitions raise a variety of questions...

* How do our constructions of meaning correspond to reality?
* Why is reality interpretable in the first place?
* How do we construct meaning?
* What types of interpretative processes are there?

I hope to explore these questions and more through a series of posts on these topics!

## Discussion Questions

**How would you define interpretation and why?**

## Personal Note

A maxim I have come up with for myself is **Something is better than nothing.** An idea unexecuted is none at all. I use this idea to remind myself that perfection is a fantasy and that just writing something is good enough. I kept distracting myself on what framework to use but I am committing to using Jekyll and deploying through GitHub. A much more ambitious goal of mine is to do a career change to science journalism and I hope this blog is my gateway into that sector.
