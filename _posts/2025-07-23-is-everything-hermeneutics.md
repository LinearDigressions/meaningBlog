# Introduction 

I was originally exposed to the notion of hermeneutics in the biblical studies context. In this way, hermeneutics is the study of interpreting religious texts. Overtime, I realized that the field of hermeneutics has become much bigger than that original religious focus. As it stands, hermeneutics is the study of interpretation in general though perhaps notably of texts. 

I find the very idea of interpretation as of utmost importance and will make a brief argument as to why hermeneutics is the foundational discipline for the human experience. For the sake of discussion, I will simply define interpretation as the transformation of data into meaning. All further definitions are beyond the scope of this article.

# 1. Interpretation as Engagement

The first reason is that the very essence of interpretation is what allows us to make contact and engage with the world around us. In terms of pure data, the sensory inputs we receive from the world are more or less noise. The uninterpreted world is no world at all. One can imagine staring at a TV with static. There is nothing to be seen and our eyes gloss over. Rather, we instinctually and immediately begin interpreting the world by transforming the raw signals into noise. Pixels become people or places. Sounds become sonnets or speech. So does this pattern continue across all our senses. 

Once ingesting the stream of data, our awareness immediately notices the bits of meaning that surround us. We now identify objects or ideas. The next step in this wondrous process is turning this meaning into action. It is sometimes done in one go and in other cases can be broken up into stages. Either way, we turn our perceptions into opportunities. A glass of water becomes a means to satisfy our thirst. Another person becomes a social opportunity. We see the true opportunities latent in the world around us. We recognize the affordances that a given object offers us. Again, without interpretation, we miss every opportunity that comes our way.

# 2. Interpretation as the Inner Life

The second reason is that our very mode of existence revolves around interpretation. Every puzzle we get is an opportunity to interpret. Granted, not all mental activity is purely interpretative but it at least must begin there. While the game of chess involves deep computation, one still must begin with interpreting the board as a set of moves when your turn arrives. One must even understand it is a game to be played in the first place! After the rules are internalized, one can shift into algorithmic processes to progress. However, one of the beautiful parts about chess is that there are layers of constructs that are to be found that extend beyond the basic rules. One can develop abstract concepts like control, balance and position that grants opportunities for new strategies. These are all interpretive acts. Thus, even in the most deductive of disciplines, the interpretive act cannot be prohibited. 

Interpretation is what gives us the capacity to handle the immense complexity of the world around us. It allows us to compress the vast amount of information into low dimensional representations that we can engage with. When we go through difficult times, one of the oft used phrases is that we are trying to "process" the situation. This is an example of meaning-making. We want to make sense or arrive upon a story that helps us begin to move on. This is interpretation gone therapeutic. 

# 3. Interpretation as the Social Life

Finally, and perhaps returning to the origins of hermeneutics itself, interpretation is the social glue that keeps us together. Through language we are constantly encoding and decoding meaning from bits of sound or scratches on paper. We seek to peer into the mind of another by the subtle clues in their speech or demeanor. We also have to make sense of the writings of others. The author is not there so we ourselves must try to model what the author must be like or what the author must have been thinking. To fail at this responsibility of making sense of other sentients can result in becoming a social outcast. We must interpret to integrate and live amongst our fellow brothers and sisters.

# But is interpretation really everything?

In a word, yes. I will now paint a few brush strokes on how I can see hermeneutics intruding upon other classical philosophical disciplines. A first note is that hermeneutics has a concept of understanding that is evolutionary in nature. We come to an understanding of a person or text but then that invites us to start over and see new items we missed before. A new layer of hermeneutics begins and so it continues layer by layer in what is sometimes called the hermeneutic circle. This is similar to how reading a math book for the first time can be painful but going back over it again and again allows deeper understanding a clarity.

To start the comparisons, hermeneutics makes perfect sense of ontology. How should we make sense of things around us? Do our constructs bear relationship to reality? Do our interpretations have ontological status? Onto Epistemology, hermeneutics is the very mechanism by which we gain knowledge. Any such attempts to define truth or knowledge must respect the doorkeeper. As for value driven branches like ethics, morality or aesthetics, one can imagine how the very frameworks to evaluate what is good or beautiful depend on a framework to be applied. These also require thought on how to reconcile opposing perspectives.

# Conclusion

Perhaps my title was overly ambitious. I will standby the claim that at least all things necessitate the hermeneutical process. Furthermore, the most fascinating questions to me encircle the hermeneutical process such as the mind-body problem. I think I am so entranced by this field because that this field is all about the generation and evaluation of meaning which no other branch seems to emphasize. It is undeniable that other fields address meanings in its various fashions. None, however, take it as seriously and central as this field does. I was listening to a podcast about central themes in a philosopher's work. I cannot imagine how such a cornerstone in my work will be anything other than interpretation. This article will be the first of many down the road. I plan to investigation the interplay with consciousness, extrinsic meaning, theism, law, and mathematics among other disciplines.
