# Introduction 

Whenever I write an algorithm, there is a sense in which the algorithm then causes my computer to operate in a particular way. At the same time, the material structure of my computer is still the same. It is made up of integrated circuits along with other hardware. The material cause and existence of my computer is evident. What becomes controversial is the claim that algorithm also deserves the same type of ontological respect. An algorithm is nothing more than materiality so claims the physicalist. In this post, I want to try to clarify my own thoughts on whether form exists and what it might mean to say so.

# Clarifications

1. Forms do not exist independent of materiality.

For the sake of my own thoughts, I am avoiding a platonist detachment of form from reality. I am drawing more on the aristotelian conception as form having existence only when physically instantiated. This is not to say that form can not be investigated in a sense detached from the physical object. Rather, I merely claim that form is not above and beyond the physical world. 

2. Forms do not contravene material causality

Similarly, I am not claiming that forms are an additional force that guides material things towards the next step. An algorithm introduces nothing new to the atoms already present in a material sense. Thus, arguments that characterize forms as a mystical force are inapplicable to my line of thought. The way I see it is that forms are in a sense an orthogonal part of reality relative to the material.

# Arguments

Here I will make a two points as to why forms ought not to be considered identical to pure physicality and motivate their ontological distinctiveness. 

1. The argument from constraint.

I have heard it said that form cannot be anything special beyond physicality because the physical substrate necessarily restricts what happens at higher levels. The physicality of the computer and its parts dictate what the algorithm can and cannot do. My thought is that the same relationship exists from the form back onto the physical. For instance, a sorting algorithm necessarily results in an ordered list of values. So for a computer, the form of the algorithm constrains the physical operations of what happens in each step and what the final result will be. Materiality constrains formality and vice versa. One might argue that form always requires a physical basis. However, materiality always exists as a matter of form. The two are interdependent. There is always stuff and the arrangement of that stuff. Why do we give ontological priority to the physical constituents over their arrangement? 

2. The argument from independence.

From an alternative perspective, one can see that form can be reflected upon without reference to any particular object. Similarly, one can consider material entities without any homage to their higher level forms. There is nothing about form that requires anything physical. Similarly, there is nothing about materiality that necessitates any abstract form. Each possesses their own independence in this sense. 

Consider again the sorting algorithm, the necessary output of that algorithm has nothing to do with the physical instantiation. Furthermore, suppose one attempts to derive the properties of the algorithm from first principles resting in physics alone. I would argue that they would have to abstract away everything physical before getting to any useful and general statements about the algorithm. I would not say this is the case for all physical systems but some have a break from the physical substrate and perhaps may constitute strong emergence. 

As a side note, this is what I think people mean when they say that some physical systems have properties that could not have been determined merely by knowing the physical constituents. For example, one can show that a sorting algorithm always sorts through a physical demonstration but one can never show it to be true in general or make a prediction of whether it will sort at all unless by going through the system step by step. This seems to show there is a higher order at play here. 

# Conclusion

I am not entirely sure what to make of this. It seems that forms have some existence beyond just the physical. I hesitate to detach them to a platonic world of forms. I do however think that they have some existence in their own right. It seems the only way to take them seriously is to consider idealism or some other metaphysic that grants mentality ontological status. Forms are ideas and they seem to exist meaning that idealism or something similar may be true. I hope to develop this further in future posts.
