# Introduction

It is well known that gym subscriptions and attendance are at an all time high at the beginning of the year. People want to be healthier this year and so they invest time into coming up with the perfect plan to get them into shape. Unfortunately, it is all to easy to fall off because of busy schedules and life. Next year will be better!

I find myself victim at times to the idea that if I just come up with the perfect plan to achieve my goals then I will actually achieve them! This seems self-evident but I hope to argue a different perspective on a better mindset on goals. Instead of plan then execution, consider execution and then plan!

# The Myth of the Perfect Plan

Just recently, I was wanting to work on my diet and spent a whole afternoon tracking the calories and macros that I consume on a daily basis. I went to a whole variety of websites to track down the nutritional facts of different foods I eat. I developed a super organized spreadsheet which neatly listed the food and their details. I could then select certain foods and find out what the total calories come out to be.

A problem I quickly encountered was: how many calories do I actually need? This is perhaps the most crucial detail and honestly I had no way to know. One can take body weight and an activity modifier to get an estimate but this was still just a guess. I had also recently been trying to walk more which only complicated matters further. I eventually realized that tracking my weight and seeing how my weight changes on a weekly basis is really the goal. Depending on the trajectory, I could work to increase or decrease my calories accordingly. There is no way I could have fully accounted for all the factors in advanced. In one sense, this is impossible. Every body is unique and so one can't know a-priori what the true caloric needs will be.

In one sense, the plan was useful. It helped me develop my intuition on which foods have this many calories. It told me whether I was getting enough protein. Planning had its merits. On the other hand, I feel into the trap that the lived experience of the plan was an afterthought rather than an integral part of the process.

# Little Changes

Another trap I have fallen into is that I need to make ambitious and grandiose changes to my life to get me back on track. Any experience with driving shows that a small change to the steering wheel can quickly turn the vehicle. Our lives are much the same way. It is the simple small changes that we make that can have lasting impacts. 

Large changes can lead to instability that can cause everything to fall apart. I have experienced this with working out. If I try an all too intense exercise plan for my body, that can be dangerous, demotivating and derailing. It might take me awhile to make another attempt. Instead, if I tried a small exercise plan. I could quickly find out what my true capacity. Small changes accumulate over time. There is no need to rush the process so long as you are consistently making changes and growing.

# Flexibility Triumphs Unpredictability

Too many changes can be a waste of time. It is unrealistic to know if all those changes will even work. It can be overwhelming. The plan may be a bad idea that you won't find out until after you tried. There are just too many unknowns that it is foolish to invest too much time investing in the perfect plan. Rather, small experiments with rapid iteration as you find out what works or doesn't is far more effective.

One modern engineering discipline is Control Theory. This field seeks to control systems like vehicles or robotics through feedback. A built in assumption for any well designed system is that error and noise will happen. The point isn't always to eliminate them but rather to provide an efficient system to get back on track. A robot's arm may be slightly adjusted too far to the left. One can try to avoid this from happening in the first place. A far more robust and sustainable approach is to incorporate a way for the system to identify and recalibrate it automatically. 

# Conclusion

Some planning is needed to get a journey started. I would argue to plan just enough to get started and then start doing it. Do as little planning as needed so as to avoid wasting time. Forming a plan is only possible through process not preemption. What is more important than having the plan is taking notes along the way and trying to learn and adapt as quickly as possible. Don't be another gym goer that fails. Visit the gym this week! Go on a walk today! Do a pushup now!
