# Introduction on Maxims 

I have found it incredibly helpful to identify short sayings that I can repeat to myself in order to help me make sense of life and make decisions. Life is so complicated combined with my tendency that I tend to overthink things that maxims come in as a life saver. There are a few key sayings that I have found particularly useful that I want to blog about. I chose this one as the first because of how often I use it in everyday life. As I grow and learn, I plan to expand each of the articles about maxims with real life examples or quotes that show how these ideas are life principles.

I went through a college campus ministry called FOCUS that emphasized "Axioms" as part of the leadership training. Much of the ideas I have about maxims or axioms are inspired by this ministry and I am grateful to them for helping me think in these terms. This ministry took the idea of axioms from a book called "Leadership Axioms" by Bill Hybels. Axiom is not a term we use very often so perhaps the closest term to what an "Axiom" is the word maxim.

Merriam-Webster defines maxim as follows:

> **maxim** *(noun)*  
> *Definition:* a general truth, fundamental principle, or rule of conduct  

I think the power of axioms is that even though life is complicated, good decision making doesn't have to be! Furthermore, axioms are massive amounts of value condensed into a single tiny statement. The goal isn't to be nit-picky about the wording but rather to internalize the principle or way of thinking that the maxim invites us into.

# Something is Better than Nothing

This axiom has three perspectives that I find extremely meaningful.

First, this axiom breaks me out of the all or nothing thinking. I am by no means perfect in carrying out my plans. I procrastinate and waste time. However, so long as there is still life in me I can still make the choice to make some concerted effort towards my goal. 

Second, this axiom helps me combat perfectionism. Even with this blog (or this post!), I am constantly caught up in wanting to rewrite and fix and edit over and over again. The problem is that eventually nothing is ever created at all. Thus, I need to remind myself that something is better than nothing.

Third, this axiom helps me not to underestimate the power of small decisions. We can often think that little decisions are unimportant or have no impact. However, especially when dealing with people, we have no clue how enormous an impact a small expression of love or kindness can have on someone else's life. I can think of a club at university that one person invited me to that ended up being the club I spent the most time with, roomed with two of them, and continue to remain close friends with the people I met there.

Here are a few variations that I also use and find conceptually similar:
* "Better late than never" or "Now is better than never"
* "It's always the right time to do the right thing." (Attributed to MLK)
* "Thanks never goes without saying."
* "It's not hard to be someone's best friend.

Finally, here are anecdotes or examples of this principle showing up.
* The Parable of the Talents
* The Feeding of the 5,000
* The story about the boy saving starfish on the beach. 
* Chaos Theory. The idea that even small tiny decisions can have enormous impacts.
