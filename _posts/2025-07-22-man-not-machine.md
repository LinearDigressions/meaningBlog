# Introduction

As part of the mechanistic way of thinking about the world, I find apply a machine like metaphor to myself. I am a system of inputs and outputs. If I am struggling with something, then the solution must be to push harder. If I want to become more, then I must do more. If I want to stop doing something, then I must use positive or negative reinforcement to do as much.

While this perspective is perhaps enticing as it seems to give us a simple set of instructions, this imagery is destructive and probably has hurt my goals more than anything else. We are organisms that operate on a completely different set of principles than machines. At first, this differences seem detrimental. We're slower. We need to sleep. We need breaks. The reward though is that we are able to an amazing suite of tasks that no machine can do.

# On Behavioralism

There are several driving forces behind this tendency to self-mechanize. I think the diminution of spirit in favor of the material has resulted in an over analogizing of the mechanistic metaphor to all aspects of life. As an example, B.F. Skinner sought to reduce all human cognition to behavior and try to reinforce behavior through incentives. The problem is that our inner lives operate on principles much higher than reward and punishment. We also have goals, dreams and ambitions. These make us much more than just pavlovian dogs responding to bells. The impact is that modifying behavior requires an internal realignment of goals and identity.

# Biology as Its Own Metaphor

There is a powerful idea from biologist Michael Levin on how machine metaphors fall short with living organisms. He argues that life is ultimately like life and any attempt to draw connections with our own creations (at least currently) will ultimately fall short.

Here's a list of a few ways that we ought to see ourselves as alive.

1. **Change requires time.**
Unlike a machine, we can't immediately swap out a few parts and "fix" ourselves or add a new skill. Rather, we need time to heal or learn or grow. Perhaps part of the reason is that our integrity would be lost if we could just swap things out however we want. The benefit is that we have true unity with ourselves. Further impacts are that growth requires time. If I am learning a new skill, it requires practice over time. The consistency over time matters more than anything else. I can't just push through and master a new skill in a day. In contrast, a machine can download a program and be "skilled" immediately. The Matrix analogy of Neo downloading programs to his brain is a fun concept but disconnected from our reality. 

2. **Rest is growth.**
A machine only makes progress when it is working. Once the factory line stops then the output ends. We can then apply this to ourselves and think we are only being productive if we are actively doing something. I'm not learning if I'm not reading. I'm not getting stronger if I'm not working out. However, we are not machines! Our bodies require sleep and recovery to grow both physically intellectually and emotionally. Furthermore, it's not just a weakness, rather those times of rest are when our bodies are actively recovering and moving us towards our goals. This provides comfort to me that it is ok to rest at times. Rest is moving me toward my goals.

# Conclusion
This principle has immense personal value to me. It reminds me that "pushing through" is a very dangerous concept. Sometimes it is useful, but other times it is antithetical to how my body works and can be a source of frustration. It reminds me that sleep is important. It reminds me that who I am does not require me to be "doing" stuff constantly. This maxim humanizes me again as well as those around me.
